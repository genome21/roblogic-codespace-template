## Introduction

The Roblogic Codespace Template project aims to provide a solid foundation for developers to quickly set up and work with a Roblogic project in a GitHub Codespace environment. The project is currently maintained by a single member, genome21. As the project grows, this governance model will be updated to accommodate additional contributors and maintainers.

## Decision-Making Process

As the sole maintainer, genome21 is responsible for making all decisions regarding the project. This includes reviewing and merging pull requests, managing issues, and guiding the project's overall direction.

In the future, if more contributors join the project, the decision-making process will evolve to include consensus building, voting, and discussions within the community.

## Key Roles

Currently, there is only one key role in the project:

1. **Maintainer (genome21)** - The maintainer is responsible for overseeing the project, making decisions, managing issues, and reviewing and merging pull requests.

As the project grows, additional roles such as contributors, reviewers, and other maintainers may be introduced.

## Responsibilities

The maintainer, genome21, has the following responsibilities:

1. Ensure the project adheres to its defined coding standards and best practices.
2. Review and merge pull requests in a timely manner.
3. Manage project issues and provide support to contributors.
4. Guide the project's direction and make decisions based on community input and needs.
5. Keep the project documentation up to date.
6. Foster a positive and inclusive environment for all contributors.
