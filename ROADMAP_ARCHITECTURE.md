## Introduction

The Roblogic Codespace Template project aims to provide a solid foundation for developers to quickly set up and work with a Roblogic project in a GitHub Codespace environment. This document outlines the project's roadmap for the next year and provides a high-level overview of the software architecture.

## Roadmap

The following roadmap outlines the planned features, improvements, and milestones for the Roblogic Codespace Template project over the next year:

1. **Enhanced GitHub Codespace integration**: Improve the integration with GitHub Codespaces, making it easier for developers to get started with a Roblogic project in a Codespace environment.

2. **Improved documentation**: Expand and improve the project's documentation to cover more use cases and provide clearer guidance for developers.

3. **Frontend and backend template enhancements**: Enhance the frontend and backend templates to include more best practices, better organization, and improved support for different tools and libraries.

4. **Community engagement**: Encourage community involvement by actively seeking contributions, discussing ideas, and promoting the project to a wider audience.

5. **Regular maintenance and updates**: Ensure that the project remains up to date with the latest Roblogic updates, dependencies, and best practices.

6. **Additional templates**: Explore the possibility of creating additional templates targeting different use cases or technology stacks.

Please note that this roadmap is subject to change based on community input, project priorities, and maintainer availability.

## Architecture

The Roblogic Codespace Template project provides a high-level software architecture based on the following components:

1. **Frontend**: The frontend is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The template includes a basic setup with essential dependencies, such as React Router for navigation and Axios for API requests.

2. **Backend**: The backend is built using Python, a versatile and widely-used programming language. The template includes a basic setup with essential dependencies, such as Flask for creating a lightweight web server and SQLAlchemy for database interactions.

3. **GitHub Codespace**: The project is designed to work seamlessly with GitHub Codespaces, providing a cloud-based development environment where developers can quickly set up and work on a Roblogic project.

The project includes a pre-configured development environment with necessary tools and dependencies for both frontend and backend development. The frontend and backend components are organized in separate directories within the project, allowing for modular development and easy integration with different deployment platforms.
