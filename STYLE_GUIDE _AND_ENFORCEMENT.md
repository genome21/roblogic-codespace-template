## Introduction

The Roblogic Codespace Template project aims to provide a solid foundation for developers to quickly set up and work with a Roblogic project in a GitHub Codespace environment. Ensuring consistent coding styles and practices is essential for maintaining code quality and readability. This document outlines the coding style guides for the primary languages used in the project and describes the automated enforcement of these styles.

## Coding Style Guides

The Roblogic Codespace Template project uses the following coding style guides for its primary languages:

1. **React (JavaScript)**: For React and JavaScript code, the project follows the [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript). This comprehensive guide covers a wide range of best practices for writing consistent and maintainable JavaScript code.

2. **Python**: For Python code, the project adheres to the [PEP 8 Style Guide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). PEP 8 is the widely-accepted style guide for Python and covers coding conventions, naming conventions, and other best practices for writing clean and consistent Python code.

Contributors are required to comply with these style guides when submitting code to the project.

## Automated Enforcement

The Roblogic Codespace Template project enforces its selected coding styles automatically, using the following FLOSS tools for each language:

1. **React (JavaScript)**: [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) is used to enforce the Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide. ESLint is a popular and flexible linting tool for JavaScript that helps ensure consistent code quality and adherence to best practices.

2. **Python**: [Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/) is used to enforce the PEP 8 Style Guide. Flake8 is a powerful and widely-used linting tool for Python that combines the functionality of several other linting tools, including Pycodestyle (for PEP 8 compliance), Pyflakes (for checking syntax errors), and McCabe (for checking code complexity).

These tools are integrated into the project's build process, ensuring that all submitted code adheres to the project's coding style guides.
