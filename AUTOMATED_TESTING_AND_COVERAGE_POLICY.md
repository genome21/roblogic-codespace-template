## Introduction

The Roblogic Codespace Template project aims to provide a solid foundation for developers to quickly set up and work with a Roblogic project in a GitHub Codespace environment. Ensuring the quality and reliability of the code is crucial, and automated testing plays a key role in achieving this goal. This document outlines the project's policies on automated testing, test coverage, and regression testing.

## Regression Testing Policy

The project maintains a policy of adding regression tests to the automated test suite for at least 50% of the bugs fixed within the last six months. This policy helps ensure that previously fixed issues do not resurface and that the project maintains a high level of quality and reliability.

## Test Coverage

The Roblogic Codespace Template project strives to achieve at least 80% statement coverage with its FLOSS automated test suite(s). This coverage requirement applies if there is at least one FLOSS tool that can measure this criterion in the selected language. High test coverage helps ensure that the majority of the codebase is tested and verified, reducing the likelihood of undetected issues.

## New Functionality Testing Policy

The project has a formal written policy that requires tests for major new functionality to be added to the automated test suite. This policy ensures that new features are thoroughly tested and verified before they are integrated into the main branch, maintaining the quality and reliability of the project.

## Change Proposal Instructions

The project's documented instructions for change proposals include the policy that tests are to be added for major new functionality. Contributors are expected to include appropriate tests for any significant new features or changes they propose. This requirement helps ensure that all new functionality is properly tested and verified before it is integrated into the project.
