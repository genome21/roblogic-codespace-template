## Introduction

The Roblogic Codespace Template project aims to provide a solid foundation for developers to quickly set up and work with a Roblogic project in a GitHub Codespace environment. Ensuring the security of the project, including its website, repository, and download site, is a high priority. One of the ways to improve security is by using hardening headers with nonpermissive values.

## Hardening Headers

The following key hardening headers with nonpermissive values are used by the Roblogic Codespace Template project:

1. **Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)**: This header enforces the use of HTTPS and helps protect against man-in-the-middle attacks and cookie hijacking.

   Example: `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains`

2. **Content-Security-Policy (CSP)**: This header defines a whitelist of allowed sources for loading content, which helps protect against cross-site scripting (XSS) and other code injection attacks.

   Example: `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'nonce-<RANDOM_VALUE>'`

3. **X-Content-Type-Options**: This header prevents browsers from interpreting files as a different MIME type, which can help protect against MIME type confusion attacks.

   Example: `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`

4. **X-Frame-Options**: This header prevents the site from being embedded within an iframe, which can help protect against clickjacking attacks.

   Example: `X-Frame-Options: DENY`

5. **X-XSS-Protection**: This header helps protect against cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks in older browsers.

   Example: `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`

## Implementation

As the Roblogic Codespace Template project is hosted on GitHub, the implementation of hardening headers primarily depends on GitHub's platform security measures. GitHub already implements several key security headers, including Strict-Transport-Security and Content-Security-Policy, on its website and repository pages.

For custom websites or download sites associated with the project, it is essential to configure the web server to include the hardening headers mentioned above. The specific implementation depends on the web server being used (e.g., Apache, Nginx, or others).
