## Introduction

The Roblogic Codespace Template project aims to provide a solid foundation for developers to quickly set up and work with a Roblogic project in a GitHub Codespace environment. Ensuring the security of the project and its dependencies is a high priority. This document outlines the security requirements and expectations for the project.

## Security Expectations

Users of the Roblogic Codespace Template project can expect the following in terms of security:

1. **Up-to-date dependencies**: The project will strive to keep all imported extension versions up to date, reducing the risk of security vulnerabilities in dependencies.

2. **GitHub security**: As the project is hosted on GitHub, users can rely on GitHub's security measures, such as HTTPS and two-factor authentication, to protect their data and contributions.

3. **Secure coding practices**: The project aims to follow secure coding practices and encourages contributors to adhere to best practices in their code submissions.

4. **Security issue tracking**: The project will actively track and address security issues that are reported or discovered within the project.

## Security Limitations

While the Roblogic Codespace Template project takes security seriously, users should be aware of the following limitations:

1. **Third-party extensions**: The project relies on third-party extensions, and their security is the responsibility of their respective owners. While the project aims to use up-to-date and secure extensions, the project cannot guarantee the security of these extensions.

2. **User contributions**: The project welcomes contributions from the community, but cannot guarantee the security of every contribution. Users are encouraged to review the code they use and report any security concerns.

3. **No warranty**: The Roblogic Codespace Template project is provided "as is" without any warranty of any kind, including but not limited to security. Users assume all risks associated with using the project.
