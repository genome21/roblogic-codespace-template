## Introduction

The Roblogic Codespace Template project aims to ensure that all contributions are made with the proper legal authorization. To achieve this, the project employs a Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) mechanism, which requires contributors to add a "signed-off-by" line to their commits.

## Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

The Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) is a lightweight mechanism for ensuring that contributors have the legal right to contribute to a project. By signing off on their contributions, contributors assert that they are legally authorized to make their contributions and that they agree to the DCO terms.

For more information about the DCO, please visit the [DCO website](https://developercertificate.org/).

## Signed-off-by Process

To sign off on your contributions to the Roblogic Codespace Template project, follow these steps:

1. Add a "signed-off-by" line to the end of your commit message, using the format `Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.email@example.com>`. Ensure that the name and email address match the ones used in your Git configuration.
2. If you are using the command line, you can use the `-s` or `--signoff` option when committing your changes: `git commit -s -m "Your commit message"`
3. When creating a pull request, ensure that your commits include the "signed-off-by" line.

## Alternative Legal Mechanisms

While the Roblogic Codespace Template project currently uses the DCO as its legal mechanism, it is open to considering alternative legal mechanisms such as Contributor License Agreements (CLAs) in the future, depending on the project's growth and requirements.
