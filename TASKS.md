The Roblogic Codespace Template project aims to provide a solid foundation for developers to quickly set up and work with a Roblogic project in a GitHub Codespace environment. We welcome contributions from new and casual contributors and strive to provide a welcoming and inclusive environment for everyone to participate in the project's development.

## Getting Started

If you are a new or casual contributor interested in contributing to the Roblogic Codespace Template project, we recommend reviewing the project's [README](https://github.com/genome21/roblogic-codespace-template/blob/main/README.md) and [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/genome21/roblogic-codespace-template/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) documents to familiarize yourself with the project and its contribution process.

## Small Tasks for New Contributors

The following is a list of small tasks that new or casual contributors can work on to get started with contributing to the Roblogic Codespace Template project:
