# Roblogic Codespace Template Security Assurance Case

This document provides a security assurance case for the Roblogic Codespace Template project, justifying why its security requirements are met. The assurance case includes a description of the threat model, clear identification of trust boundaries, an argument that secure design principles have been applied, and an argument that common implementation security weaknesses have been countered.

## Introduction

The Roblogic Codespace Template project aims to provide a solid foundation for developers to quickly set up and work with a Roblogic project in a GitHub Codespace environment. Ensuring the security of the project and its dependencies is a high priority. This document provides an assurance case that justifies why the project's security requirements are met.

## Threat Model

The following threats have been considered in the development and maintenance of the Roblogic Codespace Template project:

1. **Code injection**: The potential for malicious code to be injected into the project, either through direct code contributions or through dependencies.

2. **Unauthorized access**: The risk of unauthorized users gaining access to the project's source code, configuration files, or sensitive data.

3. **Insecure dependencies**: The possibility of vulnerabilities being introduced through third-party dependencies, such as libraries or extensions.

4. **Insufficient input validation**: The risk of improper input validation, which can lead to security vulnerabilities, such as code injection or denial of service attacks.

## Trust Boundaries

The Roblogic Codespace Template project clearly identifies trust boundaries as follows:

1. **GitHub platform**: The project relies on the security measures provided by the GitHub platform, such as HTTPS, two-factor authentication, and access controls, to protect the project's source code and data.

2. **Third-party extensions**: The project uses third-party extensions, which are considered outside the trust boundary. While the project aims to use secure and up-to-date extensions, their security is the responsibility of their respective owners.

3. **Contributors**: Contributors to the project are considered within the trust boundary. However, the project employs automated testing, continuous integration, and code reviews to ensure that all code contributions are secure and adhere to best practices.

## Secure Design Principles

The Roblogic Codespace Template project applies secure design principles in the following ways:

1. **Least privilege**: The project adheres to the principle of least privilege by limiting the access and permissions granted to users, both in the development environment and in the application itself.

2. **Defense in depth**: The project employs multiple layers of security controls, such as access controls, code reviews, automated testing, and secure coding practices, to provide defense in depth and reduce the risk of security vulnerabilities.

3. **Input validation and sanitization**: The project follows best practices for input validation and sanitization, ensuring that all user input is properly validated and sanitized before being processed by the application.

4. **Secure defaults**: The project employs secure defaults in its configuration, ensuring that the application is secure by default and minimizing the potential for misconfigurations.

## Common Implementation Security Weaknesses

The Roblogic Codespace Template project counters common implementation security weaknesses in the following ways:

1. **Regular dependency updates**: The project strives to keep all dependencies up to date, reducing the risk of security vulnerabilities in third-party libraries and extensions.

2. **Automated testing and continuous integration**: The project employs automated testing and continuous integration to ensure that all code contributions are tested and verified for security issues before being merged into the main branch.

3. **Code reviews**: All code contributions undergo a code review process, which helps identify and address potential security issues before they are merged into the main branch.

4. **Adherence to coding standards**: The project follows established coding standards and best practices for its primary languages, reducing the likelihood of introducing security vulnerabilities through coding errors.

5. **Security awareness and training**: The project encourages contributors to be aware of security best practices and provides guidance on secure coding techniques through documentation and code review feedback.
