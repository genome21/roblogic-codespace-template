## Introduction

The Roblogic Codespace Template project aims to provide a solid foundation for developers to quickly set up and work with a Roblogic project in a GitHub Codespace environment. Ensuring the quality and maintainability of the project's codebase is crucial for its success. Code reviews play a critical role in achieving this by promoting collaboration, identifying potential issues, and ensuring code consistency and adherence to best practices.

## Code Review Requirements

For the Roblogic Codespace Template project, at least 50% of all proposed modifications must be reviewed before release by a person other than the author. This review process aims to determine if the proposed modification is worthwhile and free of known issues that would argue against its inclusion.

## Code Review Process

1. **Fork and Clone**: Contributors should first fork the Roblogic Codespace Template repository and clone it locally to make changes.

2. **Create a New Branch**: Contributors should create a new branch for each feature or bug fix they work on. This ensures that the main branch remains stable and allows for easier management of multiple pull requests.

3. **Commit Changes**: Contributors should commit their changes to the new branch, adhering to the project's coding standards and best practices.

4. **Submit a Pull Request**: Once the changes are complete, contributors should submit a pull request (PR) to the main repository. The PR should include a clear description of the proposed modifications and any relevant issue numbers.

5. **Review by Another Contributor**: A person other than the author should review the PR, following the code review checklist outlined below.

6. **Address Review Feedback**: If any issues are identified during the review process, the contributor should address the feedback and update the PR accordingly.

7. **Merge the PR**: Once the PR meets the acceptance criteria, it can be merged into the main branch.

## Code Review Checklist

During the code review process, reviewers should consider the following:

1. **Adherence to Coding Standards**: The proposed changes should follow the project's coding standards and guidelines.

2. **Correctness**: The proposed changes should be free of logical errors and should not introduce new bugs or vulnerabilities.

3. **Performance**: The proposed changes should not adversely affect the performance of the project's components.

4. **Maintainability**: The proposed changes should be easy to understand, well-organized, and maintainable.

5. **Readability**: The proposed changes should be clearly written, with appropriate naming conventions and comments where necessary.

6. **Compatibility**: The proposed changes should be compatible with the project's supported platforms and environments.

7. **Test Coverage**: The proposed changes should include appropriate tests to ensure the new functionality or bug fixes work as expected.

## Acceptance Criteria

For a proposed modification to be accepted, it must meet the following criteria:

1. Pass all automated tests and checks.
2. Adhere to the project's coding standards and best practices.
3. Address any issues identified during the code review process.
4. Be reviewed and approved by at least one person other than the author.
